# JLox Interpreter Implementation

Welcome to my Lox interpreter implementation! This project is based on the fantastic book "Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom. You can find the book [here](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), and I highly recommend it for anyone interested in learning about language design and implementation.

## Overview

JLox is a programming language created in the book, and this project aims to implement its interpreter following the guidance provided by the book. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of language design concepts, lexing, parsing, and interpreter implementation.

## Project Structure

- **src**: Contains the source code for the JLox interpreter.
- **test**: Includes test cases to ensure the correctness of the interpreter.

## Getting Started

To get started with the JLox interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jp-ag/jplox.git
    cd <project-name>
    ```

2. Run the JLox interpreter:

    ```bash
    # under construction
    ```

3. Explore the source code and experiment with the language features.

## Progress

- [x] Setup project structure
- [ ] Implement lexer
- [ ] Implement parser
- [ ] Implement interpreter
- [ ] Add standard library functions
